#### Option A: Using dev.shopify.com (Recommended for your setup)
1. Go to **https://dev.shopify.com**
2. Navigate to **"Apps"** in your partner dashboard
3. Find your existing app with Client ID: `d4d69ee44cf2dd4522f73989a961c273`
4. Click on your app to open it
5. Go to **"App setup"** tab
6. Look for **"Admin API access token"** section

#### Option B: Direct Store Admin (Alternative)
1. Go to your **Shopify store admin** (your-store.myshopify.com/admin)
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Apps and sales channels**
3. Click **"Develop apps"** 
4. Click **"Create an app"**
5. Name your app (e.g., "KANE Footwear Configurator")

### 2. Configure API Permissions
Enable the following scopes for your app:

#### Product Permissions:
- `read_products` - Read product data
- `write_products` - Modify product data

#### Customer Permissions:
- `read_customers` - Read customer data
- `write_customers` - Create and modify customers

- `read_draft_orders` - Read draft orders
- `write_draft_orders` - Create and modify draft orders

#### Inventory Permissions:

- `write_inventory` - Modify inventory levels

### 3. Generate Access Token

#### For dev.shopify.com Apps:
1. In your app dashboard on dev.shopify.com:
   - Go to **"App setup"** tab
   - Scroll to **"Admin API access token"** section
   - If no token exists, click **"Generate token"**
   - **Important**: You need to install the app on a development store first!

#### Steps to Install on Development Store:
1. In dev.shopify.com, go to **"Test your app"** tab
2. Select a development store or create one
3. Click **"Install app"** 
4. After installation, go back to **"App setup"** tab
5. The **Admin API access token** will now be visible
6. Copy this token (starts with `shpat_...`)

#### Alternative - Direct Store Method:
1. After configuring permissions in your store admin
2. Click **"Install app"** 
3. Copy the **Admin API access token** that appears
4. Keep this token secure - you'll need it for the connection

**Note**: The access token is only generated AFTER you install the app on a store!

### 4. Connect to Your App
1. Visit your app at `/admin` route (e.g., `http://localhost:8091/admin`)
2. Click **"Connect to Shopify"**
3. Enter your shop domain (e.g., `your-shop.myshopify.com`)
4. Enter your access token

## Security Notes

- Client credentials are hardcoded (consider moving to environment variables)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Access Token?
**Issue**: Only seeing Client ID and Secret on dev.shopify.com

**Common Issue**: App shows broken embedded view after installation

**Root Cause**: Your app is configured as "embedded" but your React app isn't designed for iframe embedding.

**Solutions**:

#### Option 1: Fix Embedded App (Recommended)
1. In dev.shopify.com, go to your app settings
2. Find **"App setup"** â†’ **"URLs"** section
3. Configure the URLs as follows:
   - **App URL**: `https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/shopify-embedded`
   - **Allowed redirection URL(s)**: `https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/auth/shopify/callback`
4. Make sure **"Embedded in Shopify admin"** is turned ON
5. Save settings and reinstall the app
6. The embedded route is now configured to work properly in iframes

#### Option 2: Disable Embedded Mode (Easier for testing)
1. In dev.shopify.com, go to **"App setup"**
2. Look for **"Embedded in Shopify admin"** setting
3. **Turn OFF** embedded mode
4. Configure the URLs as follows:
   - **App URL**: `https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/admin`
   - **Allowed redirection URL(s)**: `https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/auth/shopify/callback`
5. Save the settings
6. **Reinstall the app** on your development store
7. After reinstalling, the access token should appear in "App setup" tab

**Note**: After changing embedded settings, you must reinstall the app!

## ðŸ“‹ Complete URL Configuration

In your Shopify app settings on dev.shopify.com, you need to configure these URLs:

### For Embedded App (Recommended):
```
App URL: https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/
Allowed redirection URL(s): https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/auth/shopify/callback
```

### For Non-Embedded App (Testing):
```
App URL: https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/admin
Allowed redirection URL(s): https://kaneconfig.netlify.app/auth/shopify/callback
```

**Note**: For embedded apps, use the root URL (`/`) - the app will automatically detect it's embedded and show the appropriate interface.

### What Each URL Does:
- **App URL**: Where Shopify loads your app (embedded in iframe or as standalone)
- **Allowed redirection URL(s)**: Where Shopify redirects after OAuth authentication

### Important Notes:
- âœ… Always use `https://` (required by Shopify)
- âœ… Use your actual domain: `kaneconfig.netlify.app`
- âœ… The redirect URL is the same for both modes
- âœ… You can add multiple redirect URLs (one per line) if needed

### Step-by-Step Token Generation:
1. Go to https://dev.shopify.com
2. Click on your app (Client ID: d4d69ee44cf2dd4522f73989a961c273)
3. Go to **"Test your app"** tab
4. Click **"Select store"** â†’ Choose or create a development store
5. Click **"Install app"** (this is crucial!)
6. After installation, go to **"App setup"** tab
7. Scroll to **"Admin API access token"** 
8. Copy the token (should start with `shpat_`)

### Connection Issues
1. Verify shop domain format (`shop.myshopify.com`)
2. Check access token validity (starts with `shpat_`)
3. Ensure all required scopes are enabled
4. Make sure app is installed on the store
5. Check browser console for detailed errors

### API Errors
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid access token or app not installed
- **403 Forbidden**: Missing required scopes
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid shop domain
- **429 Rate Limited**: Too many requests

### No Development Store?
1. Go to https://partners.shopify.com
2. Click **"Stores"** â†’ **"Add store"** 
3. Select **"Development store"**
4. Create a new development store
5. Use this store to install and test your app
