# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the visual quality and photorealism of the 3D shoe model in the ShoeViewer component. The enhancement will focus on improving rendering quality, material properties, lighting effects, and post-processing to create a more realistic and high-resolution appearance that better showcases the shoe's details and materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the 3D shoe model, I want the shoe to appear photorealistic with high-quality materials, so that I can better evaluate the product's appearance and make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D model loads THEN the shoe materials SHALL display realistic surface properties including proper reflectance, roughness, and metallic characteristics
2. WHEN viewing the shoe from any angle THEN the materials SHALL respond to lighting with physically accurate reflections and shadows
3. WHEN the lighting conditions change THEN the shoe materials SHALL maintain visual consistency and realism
4. WHEN zooming in on shoe details THEN the surface textures SHALL remain sharp and detailed without pixelation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user customizing shoe colors, I want the color changes to appear realistic with proper material properties, so that I can accurately preview how the actual shoe would look.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changing the upper or sole colors THEN the new colors SHALL maintain realistic material properties including appropriate shine, roughness, and texture
2. WHEN applying splatter effects THEN the paint splatter SHALL appear as a realistic overlay with proper opacity and blending
3. WHEN adjusting paint density THEN the splatter pattern SHALL transition smoothly while maintaining realistic appearance
4. WHEN switching between different material areas THEN each area SHALL display distinct but realistic material characteristics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the 3D viewer, I want smooth performance despite enhanced visual quality, so that the experience remains responsive and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced rendering is active THEN the frame rate SHALL remain above 30 FPS on modern devices
2. WHEN rotating or zooming the model THEN the interactions SHALL remain smooth without stuttering
3. WHEN changing colors or materials THEN the updates SHALL apply within 500ms
4. WHEN the model first loads THEN the enhanced quality SHALL be visible within 3 seconds of model load completion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the photorealistic rendering to adapt to my device's capabilities, so that I get the best possible experience regardless of hardware limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application detects a high-performance device THEN it SHALL enable maximum quality settings automatically
2. WHEN the application detects a lower-performance device THEN it SHALL use optimized quality settings that maintain good visual appearance
3. WHEN frame rate drops below acceptable levels THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality settings to maintain performance
4. WHEN quality settings are adjusted THEN the user SHALL be notified of the current quality level through visual indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over the visual quality settings, so that I can optimize the experience for my preferences and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing quality controls THEN the user SHALL be able to toggle between quality presets (Low, Medium, High, Ultra)
2. WHEN changing quality settings THEN the changes SHALL apply immediately to the 3D model
3. WHEN using high-quality settings THEN advanced features like ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, and enhanced shadows SHALL be enabled
4. WHEN the user's quality preference is set THEN it SHALL be remembered for future sessions
